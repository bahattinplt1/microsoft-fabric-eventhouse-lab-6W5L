# Microsoft Fabric - Eventhouse Lab Summary

This project is a complete walkthrough of the "Query data in a KQL database" lab provided by Microsoft Learn, implemented step by step using Microsoft Fabric.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Project Covers

- Creating a **Microsoft Fabric workspace** with Fabric capacity enabled
- Deploying an **Eventhouse** using the Real-Time Intelligence sample
- Working with the built-in **KQL database** and **Bikestream** table
- Querying data using **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**:
  - Selecting and projecting data
  - Summarizing (aggregating) data
  - Sorting and filtering records
  - Handling empty or null values with conditional logic
- Querying the same dataset using **Transact-SQL (T-SQL)** via the SQL endpoint:
  - Basic SELECT queries with column aliases
  - Grouping and summarization
  - CASE expressions for data normalization
  - Ordering and filtering grouped results

## ðŸ§  Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding how to explore and analyze real-time data in Microsoft Fabric
- Gaining hands-on experience with both KQL and T-SQL in a Fabric environment
- Identifying the differences and limitations of T-SQL support in KQL databases
- Practicing best practices for data transformation and reporting in real-time intelligence solutions
